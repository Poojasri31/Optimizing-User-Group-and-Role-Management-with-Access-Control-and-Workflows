This project focuses on optimizing user, group, and role management in ServiceNow.
Organizations often face challenges in maintaining proper access control and structured workflows for user operations.

The system developed in this project enables administrators to:

.  Create and manage users efficiently
  
.  Organize users into functional groups
  
.  Assign roles based on responsibilities
  
.  Enforce secure access through Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  
.  Automate approval workflows

By implementing these features, the solution enhances security, accountability, and operational efficiency within the platform.
